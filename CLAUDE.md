# CLAUDE.md — working notes for LD2L

A Learn Dota 2 League site. Read the README for the product overview. This file
is orientation for future work in the codebase.

## Mental model

Everything hangs off a **Season** and its `status` (the state machine):
`SIGNUPS → DRAFT → REGULAR_SEASON → PLAYOFFS → COMPLETE`. The active season is
`Season` where `isActive = true` (see `getActiveSeason`). The UI (nav + dashboard)
renders per-phase so unused features stay hidden.

## Where things live

- **Pure, unit-tested logic** (no DB): `src/lib/draft.ts`, `standings.ts`,
  `schedule.ts`, `capacity.ts`. Prefer adding logic here + a `*.test.ts` beside it.
- **Draft engine (DB, transactional)**: `src/lib/draft-service.ts` —
  `nominatePlayer`, `placeBid`, `resolveExpiredNomination`, `getDraftState`.
  The auction clock is server-authoritative; expired nominations resolve lazily
  on the next poll/action (no cron/websocket).
- **Mutations**: server actions in `src/app/actions/*` (forms) and JSON route
  handlers in `src/app/api/draft/*` (the live draft).
- **Auth**: `src/lib/auth.ts` (jose-signed cookie session), `steam.ts` (OpenID
  2.0), `users.ts` (upsert + admin granting). Dev/mock login: `/api/auth/dev`
  (gated by `ALLOW_DEV_LOGIN`). First-ever user is auto-admin. Steam name/avatar
  come from `fetchSteamProfile`/`fetchSteamProfiles` (GetPlayerSummaries, needs
  `STEAM_API_KEY`) — set on login, bulk-refreshed via admin `syncSteamProfiles`,
  and per-user via profile `refreshSteamProfile`. `<Avatar>` falls back to
  initials when `avatar` is null.
- **UI kit**: `src/components/ui.tsx` (server-safe presentational components).
  `site-header.tsx` and `draft-room.tsx` are `"use client"`.

## Conventions / gotchas

- **Node ≥ 20.18, Prisma 5.** Prisma 6/7 requires Node ≥ 20.19; this machine's
  default Node is 20.18, so we pin Prisma 5. Node 22 is installed via nvm if a
  future upgrade is wanted.
- **SQLite has no enums** — statuses are strings; the source of truth for allowed
  values is `src/lib/constants.ts`.
- **Vitest config is `vitest.config.mts`** (`.mts`, not `.ts`) — the project is
  CommonJS and Vitest's config loader needs ESM.
- After a mutation, server actions call `revalidatePath("/", "layout")`.
- **MMR cap**: `Season.maxMmr` (0 = none). `saveRegistration` rejects
  `mmr > maxMmr`; admins set it in the create-season form or via `setMaxMmr`.
- **Feedback**: risky server actions return `ActionResult`
  (`src/lib/action-result.ts`) instead of throwing; the UI wraps them in
  `<ActionForm>` (`src/components/action-form.tsx`), which toasts the result via
  the global `<Toaster>`. Use `<SubmitButton confirm="…">` for destructive
  actions. Global `error.tsx` / `not-found.tsx` / `loading.tsx` exist.
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` for a fast type check; `npm test` for unit;
  `npm run test:e2e` for Playwright (reseeds the DB first).

## Playoffs & standins (done)

- **Playoffs**: `src/lib/playoff-service.ts` — `createPlayoffBracket` seeds the
  top teams by standings; `advancePlayoffBracket` (called from `recordResult`
  when a match's phase isn't REGULAR) builds the next round from winners and
  crowns the champion when the final ends. Bracket slots are `R{round}M{match}`.
  Pure helpers live in `schedule.ts` (`pickBracketSize`, `nextRoundPairings`,
  `roundName`).
- **Standins**: `assignStandin` / `removeStandin` admin actions; the replaced
  player's roster infers which team the standin fills for. Shown on `/schedule`.

## Match data / OpenDota (done)

- `src/lib/dota.ts` — OpenDota client, SteamID64 ↔ `account_id` conversion,
  match-id/URL parsing, cached hero names. Optional `OPENDOTA_API_KEY`.
- `src/lib/match-import.ts` — `classifyGame` (pure, unit-tested) decides whether
  a fetched game is between our two teams and who won; `importGameForMatch`
  records a `Game` + `recomputeSeries`; `autoDetectGamesForMatch` scans rosters'
  recent games. Standins assigned to a match count for their team. Uses
  `Game.dotaMatchId` unique to dedupe.
- Admin: `MatchImportControls` (client, `useActionState` for inline errors) →
  `importGameAction` / `autoDetectAction`. Box score lives at `/matches/[id]`.
- Games roll up into `Match.homeScore/awayScore`; playoff game imports call
  `advancePlayoffBracket`. Note: `tsconfig` target is ES2017, so use
  `BigInt("…")` not `123n` literals.
- **Ranked medals**: `src/lib/rank.ts` decodes OpenDota `rank_tier` (pure,
  tested) → `<RankBadge>`. `fetchPlayerRankTier` fills `User.rankTier` on profile
  link/refresh (`updateDotaAccount`/`refreshRank`) and in bulk via admin
  `syncPlayerRanks`. Medals render on players/teams/draft (a captain resource).
- **In-client league sync**: `Season.dotaLeagueId` + `syncLeagueGames` (fetch
  `/leagues/{id}/matches`, `classifyGame` each vs. scheduled matches, import).
  Admin `setLeagueId` / `syncLeagueAction`. League registration is done at
  dota2.com/league; games are tagged by hosting private lobbies with the id.
- **Player questionnaire**: `Registration.roles` (comma-sep position keys,
  helpers + tests in `src/lib/roles.ts`), `favoriteHeroes`, `statement`,
  `captainNote` — captured on `/me`, surfaced in the player pool and draft room
  (`getDraftState` carries roles/heroes/note for the nominated player).

## Good next steps

- Nomination timer/auto-skip in the draft if a captain stalls (right now the
  nominator must act to advance).
- Production deploy config (swap SQLite → Postgres, real Steam key).
- Optional: sync from a Valve `leagueid` (field exists on `Season`) if the
  league ever gets ticketed — `/leagues/{id}/matches` + `classifyGame`.
